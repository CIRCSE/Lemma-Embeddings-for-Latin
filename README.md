# Lemma Embeddings for Latin
Lemma embeddings for Latin can be downloaded [here](https://embeddings.lila-erc.eu/samples/download/).

Embeddings have been evaluated on a novel benchmark for the synonym selection task available in the file *syn-selection-benchmark-Latin.tsv*.

You can visually explore the embeddings online: [https://embeddings.lila-erc.eu/](https://embeddings.lila-erc.eu/).

Results of an experiment to detect language change between the Classical era and the Medieval/Christian era are given the folder *usage-change-results*.
